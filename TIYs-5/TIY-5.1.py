# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
# another five tests evaluate to False.

pizza = 'Cheese'
fruit = 'apple'
car = 'nissan'
monitor = 'lg'
gpu = 'gtx 1060'

print(pizza.lower() == 'cheese')    # i predict true
print(pizza == 'pepperoni')    # i predict false

print(fruit == 'orange')    # i predict false
print(fruit == 'apple')    # i predict true

print(monitor == 'dell')    # i predict false
print(monitor == 'lg')    # i predict true

print(gpu == 'gtx 1060')    # i predict true
print(gpu == 'rtx 2080ti')    # i predict false

print(car == 'nissan')    # i predict true
print(car == 'audi')    # i predict false
