18-4. Pizzeria: Start a new project called pizzeria with an app called pizzas.
Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values,
such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. Define a model called Topping with fields
called pizza and name. The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and
name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and
sausage. Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some
pizza names and toppings. Use the shell to explore the data you entered.

18-6. Pizzeria Home Page: Add a home page to the Pizzeria project you
started in Exercise 18-4 (page 394).

18-8. Pizzeria Pages: Add a page to the Pizzeria project from Exercise 18-6
(page 398) that shows the names of available pizzas. Then link each pizza
name to a page displaying the pizza’s toppings. Make sure you use template
inheritance to build your pages efficiently.
