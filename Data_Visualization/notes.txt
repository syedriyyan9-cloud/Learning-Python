pyplot module is used to draw charts and graphs
subplots is used to plot many lines onto a sign chart
fig is used to contain the entire landscape of the program
ax is used to store only one plot (line on chart)
.plot() method is used to actually plot the line onto a chart
.show() method is used to display the plotted line on a chart

.plot() takes linewidth param which adjusts the thickness of the line
.set_title() method is used to set the title for the chart or graph
.set_xlabel() and .set_ylabel is used to label the x and y axis
fontsize parameters in set methods is used to adjust the size of the fontsize
.tick_params() method is used to adjust the size of marks on x and y axis
.tick_params() also takes param of labelsize which adjusts the size of ticks

When you give plot() a sequence of numbers, it assumes the first data
point corresponds to an x-coordinate value of 0, but our first point corre­
sponds to an x-value of 1. We can override the default behavior by giving
plot() the input and output values used to calculate the squares.
the first param in plot method corresponds to x-axis, and second param is y-axis
